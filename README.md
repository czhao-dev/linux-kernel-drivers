Four Linux kernel modules, each targeting a different driver subsystem and the
contract it imposes between kernel and user space, hardware, or the networking
stack. None require physical hardware: every driver builds and runs end-to-end
in Docker + QEMU against a real kernel, on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

| Driver | Subsystem | Core mechanisms |
|---|---|---|
| [`linux-character-device-driver`](linux-character-device-driver/) | Character device | `file_operations`, mutex, wait queues, blocking I/O, `ioctl` |
| [`linux-block-device-driver`](linux-block-device-driver/) | Block I/O (`gendisk`/blk-mq) | `bio`/`request` segment iteration, spinlock-protected memcpy, page cache vs. `O_DIRECT` |
| [`linux-network-device-driver`](linux-network-device-driver/) | Networking (`net_device`) | `sk_buff`, descriptor rings, NAPI, TX queue backpressure |
| [`linux-pcie-device-driver`](linux-pcie-device-driver/) | PCI / PCIe | BAR-mapped MMIO, MSI interrupts, DMA buffer management |

## Overview

Each project targets a different kernel subsystem on purpose, so that together
they cover most of the contracts a driver author has to get right.

### [`circbuf`](linux-character-device-driver/) — Virtual Character Device

A kernel module that registers `/dev/circbuf` as a bounded circular-buffer
device. Writers produce bytes into a fixed-size buffer; readers consume them in
FIFO order. When the buffer is full, writers block; when it is empty, readers
block. Multiple processes can open the device concurrently and are safely
arbitrated through kernel synchronization primitives.

**What it covers:** `file_operations` vtable (C-level polymorphism between VFS
and the driver); `copy_to_user`/`copy_from_user` for crossing the kernel/user
boundary safely; `mutex` for sleeping critical sections vs. `spinlock` for
atomic ones; `wait_queue_head_t` for blocking I/O; and `ioctl` design for
out-of-band device control. Because there is no hardware dependency, the focus
stays entirely on getting these contracts right.

**Key object:** `struct file_operations` — a vtable of function pointers the
kernel calls when user space invokes `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`, or
`release` on the device file.

---

### [`vblk`](linux-block-device-driver/) — Virtual RAM-backed Block Device

A kernel module that registers `/dev/vblk0` backed by a `vmalloc`'d region
of kernel memory. It behaves like a real disk: `dd`, `mkfs`, `mount`, and
arbitrary `pread`/`pwrite` all work against it because it implements the same
`gendisk` / `block_device_operations` / `blk_mq_ops` contract every real block
driver implements. Only the "hardware" — a contiguous kernel buffer instead of
a physical device — differs.

**What it covers:** `gendisk` + blk-mq registration (`blk_mq_alloc_disk`,
`add_disk`); `bio`/`request` segment iteration inside `queue_rq`; why a
`spinlock` is the right primitive once `copy_to/from_user` is off the table;
and the page-cache vs. `O_DIRECT` distinction that governs whether I/O ever
reaches the driver at all. The test suite validates all three paths: buffered
I/O through the page cache, `O_DIRECT` bypassing it, and a full
`mke2fs` + `mount` + file I/O + `umount` round trip through ext2.

**Key object:** `struct gendisk` paired with a `struct blk_mq_tag_set` — the
block-layer analogue of `file_operations`.

---

### [`netdrv`](linux-network-device-driver/) — Virtual Ethernet Driver Pair with NAPI

A kernel module that creates a software point-to-point Ethernet pair (`vnet0`
↔ `vnet1`) built around the same structures a real NIC driver uses: TX/RX
descriptor rings, NAPI interrupt-mitigated packet reception, and
`netif_stop_queue`/`netif_wake_queue` TX backpressure. A packet transmitted
on one interface appears as received on the other; the "wire" is software,
but the driver-side mechanics follow the real networking stack contracts.

**What it covers:** `net_device` registration and `net_device_ops`; `sk_buff`
lifecycle (allocation, headroom, push/pull); NAPI (why per-packet interrupts
would saturate the CPU and how poll-based batching avoids it); TX queue
backpressure under load; and network namespace isolation for testing. The
project includes a real end-to-end `ping` test that caught an actual bug during
development — `IFF_NOARP` made ring counters look healthy while `ping` silently
failed 100% of the time.

**Key object:** `struct net_device` — the networking stack's equivalent of
`gendisk`, paired with a `struct napi_struct` per interface.

---

### [`pcie-edu-driver`](linux-pcie-device-driver/) — PCIe Driver for QEMU's `edu` Device

A kernel module that drives QEMU's built-in `edu` educational PCI device
(vendor `0x1234`, device `0x11e8`). Unlike the virtual drivers above, this
targets a device that is enumerated over the PCIe bus, has BAR-mapped memory
registers, raises hardware interrupts, and exposes a DMA engine — it just
happens to be emulated by QEMU rather than soldered to a board. The driver
code, and everything it has to get right, is identical to what a real NIC,
storage controller, or accelerator driver requires.

**What it covers:** the full PCI driver lifecycle (`pci_enable_device`,
`pci_iomap` for BAR0 MMIO, `pci_alloc_irq_vectors` for MSI,
`dma_alloc_coherent` for DMA buffers, `pci_unregister_driver` cleanup);
`ioread32`/`iowrite32` for MMIO register access; an MSI interrupt handler that
wakes a wait queue to unblock a user-space `ioctl`; and a DMA round-trip test
(host → device → host). The driver also exposes a `misc` character device at
`/dev/pcie_edu` so user space can trigger factorial computations and DMA
transfers via `ioctl`.

**Key object:** `struct pci_dev` — the bus-enumerated device handle, paired
with BAR-mapped MMIO, an MSI interrupt vector, and a `dma_alloc_coherent`
buffer.

---

### How the Four Projects Relate

The character device establishes the kernel/user-space boundary and
synchronization primitives. The block device moves that same contract into the
block layer's request/bio model, and introduces the page-cache visibility
problem. The networking and PCIe drivers build further on that foundation while
introducing their own subsystem-specific object models (`net_device`/`sk_buff`
vs. `pci_dev`/MMIO/MSI) and execution-context rules (softirq NAPI polling vs.
hardirq MSI handling).

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | 20.10+ | Required for the recommended Docker + QEMU path |
| QEMU | 6.0+ | Embedded inside the Docker image; no host install needed |
| make / gcc | any recent | Only needed for native (non-Docker) builds |
| Linux host with matching kernel headers | — | Alternative to Docker; see each project's README |

No physical hardware, no Linux host, and no QEMU pre-install are required for
the default Docker path. Docker pulls the matching kernel headers and QEMU
image automatically.

### Quick start

Every driver follows the same pattern: build against real kernel headers inside
Docker, boot a stock kernel under QEMU, then load and exercise the module
end-to-end — not a build-only check.

```bash
# circbuf, vblk, pcie-edu-driver
cd <project-directory>
./docker/run.sh test
```

```bash
# netdrv (self-contained Docker image)
cd linux-network-device-driver
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t netdrv-e2e . && docker run --rm netdrv-e2e
```

### What the harness does

`docker/run.sh test` (and the equivalent `netdrv` command):

1. Builds the `.ko` against real kernel headers inside a Docker container.
2. Boots a stock `6.8.0-124-generic` kernel under QEMU with a minimal busybox
   initramfs.
3. `insmod`s the module, runs the test suite (basic I/O, stress, filesystem
   mount where applicable, ioctl round-trips), and `rmmod`s the module.
4. Checks `dmesg` for panics, lockups, or unexpected warnings.
5. Exits non-zero on any failure.

### Native (non-Docker) builds

Each project's README documents a native build path for environments where
Docker is unavailable. The general pattern:

```bash
make                  # build the .ko against the running kernel's headers
sudo insmod <mod>.ko
dmesg | tail -20      # confirm probe / registration
sudo ./<test_binary>
sudo rmmod <mod>
```

This requires a Linux host (or VM) with matching kernel headers and — for the
PCIe driver — a QEMU session started with `-device edu`.
